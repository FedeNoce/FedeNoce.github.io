title: "Learning Landmarks Motion from Speech for Speaker-Agnostic 3D Talking Heads Generation."
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/s2l-s2d-1
excerpt: 'A novel approach for generating 3D talking heads from raw audio inputs. This method grounds on the idea that speech related
movements can be comprehensively and efficiently described by the motion of a few control points located on the movable parts of the
face, i.e., landmarks. This paper was published at ICIAP 2023 and presented orally'
